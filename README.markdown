== VRaptor Panettone Plugin

As soon as you apply the nature:

1. panettone jar will be downloaded to `src/build/lib`
2. `src/main/views` will be created
3. views will be compiled to `target/views-classes`

Every change to `src/main/views` will be automatically reflected in your compiled classes. Have fun with your templates!
